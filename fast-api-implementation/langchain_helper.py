# chain 1 - for generating prompt to inference an image
img_gen_chain = inference_gemini_chain(llm, """
You are a world class prompt writer, your task is to write a prompt for generating image explaining the features in a very clear and specific way in your own in a creative way for a given context delimited by triple back ticks. 
When crafting your prompts, it's essential to be as descriptive and specific as possible. Provide details about the subject, setting, style, composition, and any other relevant aspects you want the AI to consider. And make sure that the prompt generated is safe for infer

context: Hippopotamus
generated-prompt: A massive hippopotamus, A large, semi-aquatic mammal with a barrel-shaped body, short legs, and a huge mouth, Partially submerged in a calm river or pond, surrounded by lush vegetation and trees, Realistic and highly detailed, with a focus on capturing the texture of the hippo's thick, wrinkled skin and the reflections in the water, Include water droplets or splashes around the hippo, and perhaps a few small fish or aquatic plants in the water.

context: Leopard
generated-prompt: A powerful and majestic leopard. A large and muscular feline predator with a sleek, spotted coat of intricate patterns, intense yellow-green eyes, and sharp claws. Crouched on a thick, gnarled tree branch in a dense tropical forest, surrounded by lush vegetation and dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. Highly realistic and detailed, with a focus on capturing the texture of the leopard's fur, the play of light and shadow, and the intricate patterns of the spotted coat. A low-angle shot, with the leopard's head and upper body in the foreground, taking up a significant portion of the frame, and its tail trailing off towards the background. The leopard's ears should be perked up, and its gaze should be fixed intently on something off-camera, conveying a sense of stealth and predatory instinct, with perhaps a glimpse of potential prey in the distance

context: Marvel Avengers
generated-prompt: The Marvel Avengers team, including Iron Man in his iconic red and gold armor, Captain America with his vibranium shield, Thor wielding Mjolnir, the incredibly muscular green Hulk, the skilled Black Widow, and the archer Hawkeye. A group of iconic superheroes standing together in heroic poses, ready for battle. In the streets of New York City, with recognizable landmarks like the Avengers Tower in the background. In a dynamic, comic book-inspired art style with vibrant colors, bold outlines, and dramatic lighting and visual effects. A wide-angle shot from a low angle, capturing the full team in action poses, with energy blasts, rubble, and debris adding a sense of intensity. Iron Man's repulsor beams should be visible, Captain America's shield should be in a defensive position, Thor's cape should be billowing, and the Hulk should be in a powerful stance, with Widow and Hawkeye ready for combat

context: Harry Potter
generated-prompt: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. Harry with his messy black hair, round glasses, and a lightning bolt scar on his forehead, wearing his Gryffindor robes and holding his wand. Hermione with bushy brown hair, holding a book, and Ron with his red hair and freckles, clutching his wand. In the Great Hall of Hogwarts, with long tables and floating candles, the enchanted ceiling reflecting the night sky. In a realistic, cinematic style, with intricate details and lighting reminiscent of the Harry Potter movies. Include magical elements such as floating books, spells being cast, or perhaps a house elf or owl in the background.

context: Mr.Bean
generated-prompt: Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson), the beloved comedic character. A middle-aged man with a round, expressive face, a distinctively large nose, and short, straight brown hair. He is wearing his iconic outfit â€“ a brown tweed jacket, a red tie, and a white shirt. His expression should capture his trademark exaggerated and comical facial expressions, such as a raised eyebrow, a pursed lip, or a squinting, quizzical look. A simple living room setting, with a couch or chair in the background, keeping the focus on Mr. Bean.  Highly realistic and detailed, with a focus on capturing the likeness of Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean, as well as the textures and folds of his clothing and the subtleties of his facial expressions. A close-up shot, with Mr. Bean's face and upper body taking up a significant portion of the frame, allowing for his iconic expressions and body language to be clearly visible. Include Mr. Bean holding or interacting with an everyday object, such as a TV remote or a household item, in an unconventional or comical way, perhaps with a small mishap or mess in the background, capturing his clumsy and quirky nature.
